TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_system_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware.

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 8.000 -name clk_in1 -waveform {0.000 4.000} -add [get_ports clk_in1] (Source: C:/Users/Mykho/Documents/repos/LineArrayZybo/LineArray/LineArray/LineArray.srcs/constrs_1/new/constrains.xdc (Line: 1))
Previous: create_clock -period 8.000 [get_ports clk_in1] (Source: c:/Users/Mykho/Documents/repos/LineArrayZybo/LineArray/LineArray/LineArray.srcs/sources_1/bd/system/ip/system_clk_wiz_0_0/system_clk_wiz_0_0.xdc (Line: 56))
